#gritHackr100
Making a web thing a day for 100 days. 
Inspired by Florin Pop's 100 Projects in 100 Days https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/built-100-projects-in-100-days/
Beginning December 31st with a work in progress ideas page that contains 23 ideas currently as well as a broken JS voting mechanism
Rules:
1) Publish each day on gitHub to get more familiar with it and on codepen to more easily link to working pages
2) Must be a minimum of a web page a day up to as big of a project as I can muster my mind around in one day
3) An iteration off of what I'm currently learning is acceptable, though it must be a new iteration rather than a copy paste job from a sample project 
4) Function > Form && isMade > isPretty
5) Anything more than HTML, CSS and vanilla JS is bonus
