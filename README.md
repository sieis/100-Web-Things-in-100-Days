# gritHackr100 3/20/20 UPDATE:
As the COVID-19 fear and virus sweep over the earth, I continue on my quest, and I have now delved into MongoDB and the first two versions of a full YelpCamp web application in Colt's Udemy course. Myself and, I'm sure, thousands of others before me. Beginning to reach out to actual developers now to hopefully spark some kinships, find some inspiration and discover a calling, a path, a vision for what things I will myself create.

2/20/20 UPDATE:
Continual learning in Udemy as we dove into backend and Nodejs recently. I am itching to build more things and be able to devote time to that end, but know that the gauntlet of learning, particularly in these formational skills, is a necessary step forward. 
1/12/20 UPDATE:
Things are going splendid, however, I'm amending my original aspiration. Mainly due to the fact that I simply don't have the skillset to make a lot of stuff that I'd like to. In the interest of not creating the same type of basic front end splash pages over and over, I'm turning this into the classic 100 Days of Code challenge which is where it should have begun anyway. I am dying to get into some back-end knowledge, and will be much better served by digesting the rest of the full-stack Udemy course that I am now half way through. There are plenty of items I'll still be building just for my own website that will I trust satisfy my thirst to create real things which was the impetus for this little shindig as well.
I've discovered the project euler challenges too, and will be dabbling :) https://projecteuler.net/archives
I'll keep updating this repo as I make new things, but will not be requiring a daily link to a built thing.
My most edited project will likely remain my website as I continue to learn how to make it more beautiful and functional: https://eamonncottrell.com/ And, bonus points, it is entirely hosted on gitHub which has been a wonderful way to get in the habit of maintaining a project online.

Making a web thing a day for 100 days. 
Inspired by Florin Pop's 100 Projects in 100 Days https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/built-100-projects-in-100-days/
Beginning December 31st with a work in progress ideas page that contains 23 ideas currently as well as a broken JS voting mechanism
Rules:
1) Publish each day on gitHub to get more familiar with it and on codepen to more easily link to working pages
2) Must be a minimum of a web page a day up to as big of a project as I can muster my mind around in one day
3) An iteration off of what I'm currently learning is acceptable, though it must be a new iteration rather than a copy paste job from a sample project 
4) Function > Form && isMade > isPretty
5) Anything more than HTML, CSS and vanilla JS is bonus
