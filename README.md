#gritHackr100

1/12/20 UPDATE:
Things are going splendid, however, I'm amending my original aspiration. Mainly due to the fact that I simply don't have the skillset to make a lot of stuff that I'd like to. In the interest of not creating the same type of basic front end splash pages over and over, I'm turning this into the classic 100 Days of Code challenge which is where it should have begun anyway. I am dying to get into some back-end knowledge, and will be much better served by digesting the rest of the full-stack Udemy course that I am now half way through. There are plenty of items I'll still be building just for my own website that will I trust satisfy my thirst to create real things which was the impetus for this little shindig as well.
I've discovered the project euler challenges too, and will be dabbling :) https://projecteuler.net/archives
I'll keep updating this repo as I make new things, but will have the running, daily checklist of what I did regardless of whether there was a project submitted here: https://eamonncottrell.com/gritHackr100.html

Making a web thing a day for 100 days. 
Inspired by Florin Pop's 100 Projects in 100 Days https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/built-100-projects-in-100-days/
Beginning December 31st with a work in progress ideas page that contains 23 ideas currently as well as a broken JS voting mechanism
Rules:
1) Publish each day on gitHub to get more familiar with it and on codepen to more easily link to working pages
2) Must be a minimum of a web page a day up to as big of a project as I can muster my mind around in one day
3) An iteration off of what I'm currently learning is acceptable, though it must be a new iteration rather than a copy paste job from a sample project 
4) Function > Form && isMade > isPretty
5) Anything more than HTML, CSS and vanilla JS is bonus
