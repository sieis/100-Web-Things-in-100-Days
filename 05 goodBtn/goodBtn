After realizing at the end of yesterday that I coded all my podcast subscribe buttons as buttons instead of links, I decided to focus in on one element today: just the button itself. This one has a nice hover effect that is pleasing on Desktop and looks pretty solid all around. Better than the buttons in the podCard from yesterday
